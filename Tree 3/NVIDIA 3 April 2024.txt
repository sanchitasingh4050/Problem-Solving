login DGX
write on terminal- ssh user8@192.168.43.101
password- user8 (if it asks)
we need to send from local system to dgx system server
navigate to the location where the folder is saved (not inside the folder) by using the cd command then write the below command
scp -r name_of_the_folder user8@192.168.43.101:/home/user8
the above command will take some time for the transfer of the folder as the folder will get uploaded from our local system to the DGX server
once the transfer gets completed!
write- ls (the folder will be displayed here then)
cd PPE-VIOLATION-DETECTION
ls
vim
